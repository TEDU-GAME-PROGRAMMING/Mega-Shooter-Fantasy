## Project Summary/Explanation

The game has various facilities including skills, weapons, armors, melodies, stories, NPCs, character stats, story changing decisions. The mega shooter fantasy project has 2 parts; those are algorithm background and gameplay mechanics.

## Algorithm backgrounds
These algorithms will include more rendering based approaches for optimization as well as mathematical calculations and all NPCs decisions. In addition to that game supports A* search algorithm for path finding. To make the inventory system more lightweight, it will implement a heap priority queue. Also, to enable enemies to make rational decisions, enemies have a minimax algorithm where enemies try to minimize the player's advantage when player is trying to maximize his advantage in zero sum games.
## Gameplay mechanics
These mechanics will be implemented. Similar to the player, each enemy will have specific characteristics and stats such as level, health, attributes etc. Through this way, then the world will be more dynamic, lively, and present challenges to the player. Also, the game has a day-night loop that affects the gameplay style of the player. In day time, light type spells and enemies will gain buff, same way in night time dark type spells and enemies will gain buff. In the menu, the player will have numerous functionalities such as starting a new game, saving and loading, manipulating quality settings. In the options menu, sensitivity setting and master volume control, quality, screen resolution options can be found.

He wanted to inspect the portal, but he realized that the force field of the portal was too powerful. Not being able to escape the force field, he enters the portal. When he opened his eyes, he realized he was in a totally different world. Initially, he finds a wise creature there. This creature will guide the player in his quest for returning home safely. This world was devastated by a big war and the technological advancements were lost. He will be fighting the monsters that populate the planet. Even if he hates working with these monsters, he must choose a side. The clans which will be chosen at the campaign menu.
